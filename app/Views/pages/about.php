                  <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 45px;">Being a web developer is my dream. When studying parts of the website I like several materials: providing suitable colors combined with web layouts, looking for suitable algorithms to be applied in program code, studying frameworks, making database design strategies. Even though I feel tired, I will be happy if the website in my imagination can be realized. All I have to keep doing is finding new experiences and continuing to practice with projects. For those of us who have the same dream, cheer up! do not give up with difficult things, everything must have a solution.</p>
